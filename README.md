# ZipExec
ZipExec is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) tool to wrap binary-based tools into a password-protected zip file. This zip file is then base64 encoded into a string that is rebuilt on disk. This encoded string is then loaded into a JScript file that when executed, would rebuild the password-protected zip file on disk and execute it. This is done programmatically by using COM objects to access the GUI-based functions in Windows via the generated JScript loader, executing the loader inside the password-protected zip without having to unzip it first. By password protecting the zip file, it protects the binary from EDRs and disk-based or anti-malware scanning mechanisms.

Usage of ./ZipExec:
  -I string
        Path to the file containing binary to zip.
  -O string
        Name of output file (e.g. loader.js)
  -sandbox
        Enables sandbox evasion using IsDomainedJoined.
